## My Own Work

React's create app library generated the basic structure of the project. I changed the structure slightly to suit my needs.
Everything in the `src` folder other than `css` is my work. I have edited the following files:
* `package.json`
* `manifest.json`
* `index.html`

I also added the `.circleci` folder which contains the config for CircleCI's continuous integration service.
